# Resume-Email
My Resume email.

It doesnt seem that anyone wants to reply to an email thats just a simple resume without any expierence, a portfolio, or a cover letter.
So I thought it may be a better idea to just combine them all together.
This is my email.html, CV, Cover letter, and example of my level of ability. 
Most of the framework is copy paste from other sources, and all the pictures are from google search.
I am only responsible for the content, and some mods to the layout and style.
This is a quick example page of my capabilities, not because I was too lazy to take the time to make it more complex, but because I need a job yesterday, and time is of the essence.
